# Smart Industry Using Cisco Packet Tracer
I am designing a Smart Industry for my project I want to work on the Corporate plan of Industry, Where we can use all IOT devices for making a particular Industry as Smart Industry. So, I have decided to take Transport Industry for my project to make a Smart industry in Cisco packet tracer.

## Project features:

**RFID Based Door Lock:** <br>  Door can be unlocked only by using a valid RFID card. If anyone wants to enter the office, he or she has to show RFID. If the RFID is valid, the door will be opened, otherwise not.<br>
**Smart Fan, based on Temperature:** <br>Smart Fan which will be started automatically when it’s high temperature using Thermostat. If the temperature is low then the fan turns off automatically.<br>
**Solar Power battery charging:** <br>Based on solar power, motor and led will be running automatically. But, if the battery power finishes, they won’t be running. The battery only charges itself when there is sufficient light.<br>
**Anti-theft protection:** <br>To provide anti-theft protection motion sensor is being used, if anyone enters through the entrance door the sensor will give the alert and camera will turn on.<br>
**Auto Light:** <br>When anyone enters the room, light turns on itself detecting the motion.<br>
**Server Services:** <br>In industry there is a server which provides the various services like: HTTP, DHCP, DNS, Email, FTP.<br>
**Fire alarm:** <br>If anything catches fire, the fire detector will give a siren to alert everyone and open a fire sprinkler.<br>
**Smart garage:** <br>When The car is turned on then the garage door will open itself when it detects smoke. Garage door closes itself when there is no smoke, meaning either the car is far or it’s turned off inside the garage.<br>
Smart Industry: Every component like fan, light, window, camera, door is operating on wireless Tablet for comfortableness.
**IOT devices:** Fan, light, Window, Garage, Door, camera, AC, Battery, Siren, Solar panel, Appliance, Motion Detector, Old car, Fire monitor, RFID card, RFID reader, fire sprinkler, Smoke detector, Smoke sensor, led, sirun, alarm. 
**As programing bases I used two languages:** Python, Javascript. *For that I use MCU Board For fire monitor and motor and led control.
